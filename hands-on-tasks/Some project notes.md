Classical mechanics, also known as Newtonian mechanics, is a fundamental branch of physics that describes the motion of objects under the influence of forces. This field is governed by a set of principles and equations developed by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. Below are some key concepts and equations in classical mechanics:

## Newton's Laws of Motion

- **First Law (Law of Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force.
- **Second Law (F = ma):** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
    - The equation is represented as: $F = ma$, where
      - $F$ is the net force applied to the object.
      - $m$ is the mass of the object.
      - $a$ is the acceleration produced by the force.
- **Third Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## Kinematics

- Kinematics deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces causing that motion.
- Key equations:
    - **Position as a function of time:** $x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
    - **Velocity as a function of time:** $v(t) = v_0 + at$
    - **Acceleration as a function of time:** $a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}$

## Work and Energy

- Work done on an object by a force is defined as: $W = \int F \cdot ds$
- Kinetic energy of an object: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy: $W_{net} = \Delta K$
- Potential energy:
    - Gravitational potential energy: $U = mgh$
    - Elastic potential energy: $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

## Circular Motion

- Objects moving in a circular path experience centripetal acceleration, which is directed toward the center of the circle.
- Centripetal acceleration: $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$
- Centripetal force: $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

## Momentum

- Momentum ($p$) is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity: $p = mv$
- Impulse ($J$) is the change in momentum and is related to force and time: $J = Ft$
- The Law of Conservation of Momentum states that in a closed system, the total momentum remains constant.
